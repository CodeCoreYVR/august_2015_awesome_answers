<%# the form_for helper method can take an ActiveRecord object as a first arguement
    for instance, @question which is of class Question.
    Rails, by convention, will do the following:
    1. If @question is not persisted in the database, it will make the action for
       the form `questions_path`. It will look for the class name of the passed
       object (in this case its Question) and by convention submit to questions_path.
       It will also make the method POST in this case. (New / Create)
    2. If @question is persisted to the database, it will make the action for
      the form go to question_path (/questions/:id) (where :id is the id of
      @question) and it will make the form submit a PATCH request in order for this
      form to submit to the update action in our controller. (Edit / Update)
